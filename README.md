 ~~ Face Recognition System Using FER Dataset ~~
 A face recognition system built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the FER dataset from Kaggle for facial expression analysis.

 ~~ Project Overview ~~
This project utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection and trains a model using the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset to classify facial expressions. The system can detect and recognize emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral.

~~ Technologies Used ~~
1. Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model training)
4. Haar Cascade Classifier (for face detection)
5. FER Dataset (Facial Expression Recognition dataset from Kaggle)

 ~~ Features ~~
1. Detects faces using Haar Cascade.
2. Recognizes facial expressions with deep learning.
3. Visualizes classification results with Matplotlib.
4. Real-time emotion recognition using OpenCV.
